### Hello, friends! <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/MartinHeinz/MartinHeinz/master/wave.gif" width="30px">!

My name is Madars Dāvids and I am a software developer with a background in Biology and Biotechnology related work fields. I live in Latvia and you can find me on [![LinkedIn][1.1]][1].

📖 My Tech Stack: 

JAVA, 
Spring Boot (Maven&Gradle), 
Unit Testing, 
TDD, 
GIT, 
HTML&CSS, Angular, JavaScript, TypeScript& NodeJS basics
